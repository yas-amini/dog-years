//1. Create a variable named myAge and set it equal to your age as a number. Write a comment that explains this line of code.
// Variable for my age
const myAage = 30;
//2. Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it. Note, the value saved to this variable will change. Write a comment that explains this line of code.
// Variable for first two years

let earlyYears = 2;
//3. Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign to earlyYears. 

earlyYears *= 10.5;
//4. Since we already accounted for the first two years, take the myAge variable , and subtract 2 from it. Set the result equal to a variable called laterYears. Weâ€™ll be changing this value later.  
//takes age and subtracts 2
let laterYears = myAage - 2;

// Multiply the laterYears variable by 4 to calculate the number of dog years accounted for by your later years. Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply and assign in one step. 
//Multiplying later years by 4
