//1. Create a variable named myAge and set it equal to your age as a number. Write a comment that explains this line of code.
// Variable for my age
const myAage = 30;
//2. Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it. Note, the value saved to this variable will change. Write a comment that explains this line of code.
// Variable for first two years

let earlyYears = 2;
//3. Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign to earlyYears. 

earlyYears *= 10.5;
//4. Since we already accounted for the first two years, take the myAge variable , and subtract 2 from it. Set the result equal to a variable called laterYears. We’ll be changing this value later.  
//takes age and subtracts 2
let laterYears = myAage - 2;

// 5.Multiply the laterYears variable by 4 to calculate the number of dog years accounted for by your later years. Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply and assign in one step. 
//Multiplying later years by 4
laterYears *= 4;

//6. If you’d like to check your work at this point, print earlyYears and laterYears to the console. Are the values that you expected? 

//7. Add earlyYears and laterYears together, and store that in a variable named myAgeInDogYears .

//8. Let’s use a string method next. Write your name as a string. Call its built-in method .toLowerCase() ,and store the result in a variable called myName. The toLowerCase method returns a string with all lowercase letters.
